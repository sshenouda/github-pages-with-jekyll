### I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my life!
Throughout my highschool career I have run varsity cross country and track, participated in severeal community service activities and I am a member of Coptic Club here at my highschool. Aside from these I also enjoy painting and baking. As I continue in my highschool career I hope to excel and make use of all the amazing resources that East Brunswick highschool has to offer.
